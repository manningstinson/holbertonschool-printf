# Hi, my name is Brandon Montezuma and I am going to Holberton to learn AR/VR and software. My journey stated out modding Borderlands games for people, I did it so much I ended up becoming a moderator for several Facebook groups this later developed into a passion and wanted to make my own games so I stated teaching myself Unreal Engine 5. I have become morefamilure with it and have created several pieces I am very proud of. I am going to start my own gaming company and eventually get better with VFX. Along with attending Holberton I have about 20 classes I am taking on Udemy, all having to do with Unreal Engine 5, Blender, VFX, Blueprints, Game Design, Animations, Environment Design, C++ (WHY IS EVERYTHING C++), and several other classes dedicated to developing myself and my future company I want to start.
