# About main.h
This is the code for our main.h file

Certainly, let's break down the provided code into individual code blocks and explain it at a junior high level for your README.md document:

```c
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
```

These lines are a part of the header file "main.h." They are known as include guards and are used to prevent the header from being included more than once in the same source code. The `#ifndef` checks if the symbol `MAIN_H` is not defined. If it's not defined, it defines it using `#define MAIN_H`. The subsequent `#endif` at the end of the file closes this conditional inclusion, ensuring the content is only included once. The header also includes `<stddef.h>` and `<stdarg.h>` which are standard C library headers.

```c
/**
 * struct specifier - Structure to hold format specifiers and instructions.
 * @specifier: The format specifier character.
 * @print_func: A pointer to the corresponding printing function.
 */
```

This is a comment block that describes a structure named `specifier`. It explains that this structure is used to hold information about format specifiers, including the specifier character and a pointer to the corresponding printing function.

```c
typedef struct specifier
{
	char specifier;
	int (*print_func)(va_list args);
}
specifier_t;
```

This code defines the `specifier` structure. It specifies two components: `specifier` of type `char`, which holds the format specifier character (like 'c', 's', etc.), and `print_func` of type pointer to a function, which points to the function responsible for printing or handling that specifier. The structure is then given an alias name `specifier_t`.

```c
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
int _putchar(char c);
int print_char(va_list args);
int print_string(va_list args);
int print_percent(va_list args);
int print_int(va_list args);
specifier_t get_specifier(char c);
```

These lines define function prototypes. They declare functions that are defined elsewhere in your code. The function prototypes include `_printf`, `_putchar`, and various `print_...` functions, which are responsible for printing different types of data. The `get_specifier` function is used to find the appropriate printing function for a given format specifier.

```c
#endif
```

This line closes the `#ifndef` block started at the beginning of the file, effectively ending the conditional inclusion. It ensures that the content of "main.h" is only included once in a source code file.

In summary, this code defines a header file named "main.h" that provides function prototypes and a structure (`specifier_t`) for managing format specifiers and associated printing functions in your C program. The include guards prevent multiple inclusions, and the structure allows for easy association between specifiers and their respective handling functions.
