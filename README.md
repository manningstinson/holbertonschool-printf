# About lp_printint.c
## Explaining the code

In summary, this code defines a function `print_int` that takes an integer from a variable argument list and prints it to the standard output. It handles negative numbers, determines the number's magnitude, and iteratively extracts and prints each digit using `_putchar`. The function returns the total number of characters printed.

```c
#include "main.h"
#include <stdio.h>
```
These lines include necessary header files. "main.h" is a custom header file specific to your project, and `<stdio.h>` is a standard C library header.

```c
/**
 * print_int - Prints an integer to the standard output.
 * @args: A va_list containing the integer to be printed.
 *
 * Return: The number of characters printed.
 */
```
This is a comment block that describes a function named `print_int`. It explains what the function does, what it takes as an argument, and what it returns. In this case, it returns the number of characters printed.

```c
int print_int(va_list args)
{
    int n = va_arg(args, int);
    int len = 0;
    int divisor = 1;
    if (n < 0) {
        len += _putchar('-');
        divisor = -divisor;
    }
```
This code defines the `print_int` function. It takes a variable argument list (`va_list`) as its argument. It starts by extracting an integer (`n`) from the variable argument list using `va_arg`. It also initializes two variables, `len` to count the number of characters printed, and `divisor` to help print the integer.

If the integer `n` is less than 0 (negative), it adds a '-' sign to the output, increments `len`, and changes the `divisor` to be negative. This is done to handle negative numbers.

```c
    while ((n / divisor) > 9 || (n / divisor) < -9)
        divisor *= 10;
```
This part of the code calculates the appropriate `divisor` value to divide the integer `n` for printing. It keeps increasing the `divisor` until it's smaller than 10 or greater than -10. This way, it determines the magnitude of the number to correctly format and print it.

```c
    while (divisor != 0) {
        len += _putchar((n / divisor) + '0');
        n = n % divisor;
        divisor /= 10;
    }
    return len;
}
```
In this section, the code iteratively divides the integer `n` by the `divisor` to extract each digit from the number and print it. For each digit, it uses `_putchar` to print it and increments `len` to keep track of the number of characters printed. After printing all the digits, it returns the total length.
