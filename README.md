Colons can be used to align columns.

| Files          | Description     
| ------------- |:-------------:
| loudpirate    | right-aligned
| col 2 is      | centered
| zebra stripes | are neat  

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
