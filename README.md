## About the printf project
This project is a recreation of the printf function in the C standard library. It was created as part of the Holberton School - Tulsa curriculum. 

## Branches & Files
To keep all files, and directories organized we created individual branches for each major file.  This will assist in ensuring a clean file merge when everything is ready to be moved to the `main` (production) branch. Below is a list of all branches, and files with a description of its contents.

<!--

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
